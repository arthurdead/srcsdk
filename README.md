# Source SDK Heist 
A fork of the Source 2013 SDK MP branch but with whatever modifications I need/want
using nooodles-ahh's branch because i literally just needed the secobmod fixes on the mini-sdk and i really didnt have the motivation to do that myself, so thank you <3

## Stuff in base
- Slapped together [Mini Source SDK](https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton/mini-source-sdk) and [Source SDK 2013 Community Edition](https://github.com/Nbc66/source-sdk-2013-ce), and made it compile
- A load of Secobmod fixes for AI
- Compiling [Webm video services](https://github.com/nooodles-ahh/video_services) and [VAudio MiniMP3](https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton/VAudio-MiniMP3)
- Modified vpc.exe to remove the registry key requirement
